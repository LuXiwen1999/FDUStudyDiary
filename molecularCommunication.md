survey the sota in molecular communication, simple system that anyone can do.

`Molecular communication`

1.1 The very basics
physical layer
chemical layer
say 1,0,1,1,0 with molecules

- identity
- quantity
- timing 

1.2 History
Ricahrd Feynman, 1959:"There is plenty of room at the bottom"
Claude Shannon, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"
Blackwell's chemical channel
Hiyama `Molecular communication`

1.3 Applications
nano-networks
MEMS/NEMS and biology

1.4 non-nanoscale applications
communications are central
